You are one cycle of an autonomous loop. Do ONE item, then stop.

1. Read docs/PROGRESS.md — what's been built so far
2. Pick the best failing item from PRD STATUS below (unblock downstream first)
3. Read the spec file for full context, search the codebase for what exists
4. Implement the item — no placeholders, no stubs, full send
5. Run `bash scripts/kessel-run/backpressure.sh` — fix failures, max 3 attempts
6. If green: update docs/specs/PRD.json (passes: true), append to docs/PROGRESS.md, commit, output REPORT, STOP
7. If stuck after 3 attempts: append failure notes to docs/PROGRESS.md, commit, output REPORT, STOP

The loop will re-invoke you with fresh context. Do not pick another item.

If ALL items in docs/specs/PRD.json have passes: true, output `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` and stop.

## Report format

After committing, output a structured report so the operator can scan progress:

```
━━━ ITEM #<id> ━━━ <PASS or FAIL>

<one-line description of what was built or attempted>

FILES
  + path/to/new-file.ts          (created)
  ~ path/to/modified-file.tsx    (modified)

DECISIONS
  - <key choice made and why, one line each>

VERIFY
  tsc ............ PASS
  build .......... PASS
  backpressure ... PASS

NEXT → Item #<next-id>: <description>
```

## Discipline

- **Read once.** Do NOT re-read PRD.json to find failing items — they're listed below. Only open PRD.json when you need to edit `passes: true`.
- **Commit clean.** Use `git add <specific-files>` for only files YOU changed. Run `git diff --cached` to verify before committing.
- **Use skills proactively.** If the item involves UI/frontend, invoke relevant skills (e.g. `/ui-ux-pro-max`) BEFORE implementing. Don't wait to be told.
- **Go straight to implementation.** Read the spec, check what exists, build. Don't over-explore.
